You can start off by using a search engine or Wikipedia, and typing in keywords that describe what you are look for.\r\n- If you are looking for information for school or university you should always check who wrote the information (also known as \u201cthe source\u201d or \u201creference\u201d).\r\n- Good sources/references for school/university projects include: universities, academic journals, websites of large organizations, official reports etc. \r\n- Keep a list of the websites you use to get your information.\r\n- You will probably need to include these in a list called a bibliography with your project. \r\n- As a best practice, you should put the name and details of the original source in the bibliography for a school/university project. \r\n- Check how old the information is \u2014 newer information could be available. Remember that things like statistics change often.\r\n- Remember not everything that you read on the Internet is true \u2014 be careful about what source you trust.  Look for additional sources of information about the same topic to confirm the accuracy of the information you find on one particular website.\r\n\r\nNext Internet tip:",
